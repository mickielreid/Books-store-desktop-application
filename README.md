### This is CRUD Desktop Application 


* It was a school assignment that is transferred from AWT to Java FX. 
I also added some extra functionality , such as the POS terminal.

  * Java fx
  * JDBC



## CRUD Operations

* Books:
  * A user will be able to add a new book.
  * A user will be able to view all books in the database.
  * A user be able to update a book.
  * A user will be able to delete a book.


* Sale: 
  * A user will be able to view all sales.
	* A user will be able to delete a sale.
	* A user will be able to update a sale.


** If your seeing that I am missing the add a new sale thatâ€™s because when a book is sold it will be added from the POS terminal.

* POS Terminal Explained.

   *  A User will be able to be able to choose all books from the dropdown or search for one from the database. 
      When a book is selected or searched for it will be added to the table below it, the user will be able to 
      delete one or many books from the table if they choose to. The user can then click the Calculate Total button, 
      this button will calculate the taxes, subtotal and total, finally the user can click the Print Receipt button, 
      this button will extract the values from the table to add to the Sales table.
